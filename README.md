This script helps you to UNDO all the check-outs by others to a specific TFS branch. As a TFS admin, I have run into the issue of developers checking out files in their workspace and leaving it that way. When I try to archive/move the branches to other folders, TFS doesn't let me and wants to undo all those checkouts. The TFS Power tools helps you to see and undo others checkout from within Visual studio. But it can only perform the UNDO operation for one user at a time. So that means if 50 developers have each checked out 1 file, then I will have to press UNDO button 50 times. So I wrote a powershell script which queries the TFS to find the list of users/files checked out, then it loops through and UNDO all the files to those users.
